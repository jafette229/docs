# Flowxi Documentation

## Platform overview

This documentation describes the **Flowxi backend platform**.

Flowxi is the internal banking and financial infrastructure powering Flowxi products.
It is designed for **frontend developers**, **internal teams**, and **technical stakeholders**
to understand, integrate, and operate the system safely in production.

This is **not a public API**.  
It is a **controlled platform** with strict security, compliance, and localization rules.

## Who this documentation is for

This documentation is intended for:

- **Frontend developers**  
  Integrating authentication, wallets, payments, and user flows.
- **Internal teams**  
  Operating, monitoring, and extending the platform.
- **Investors & auditors**  
  Reviewing architecture, security principles, and compliance posture.

## What Flowxi provides

Flowxi exposes a structured backend with clear responsibilities:

- **User lifecycle management**  
  Registration, authentication, 2FA, status, and access control.
- **Wallet & balance infrastructure**  
  Secure custody, balance tracking, and transaction history.
- **Financial operations**  
  Transfers, movements, and auditable money flows.
- **Compliance primitives**  
  KYC, KYB, document handling, and regulatory states.
- **Localization-first APIs**  
  Errors, emails, and responses localized per user  
  (FR default, EN fallback).
