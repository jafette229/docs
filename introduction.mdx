# Platform Introduction

This page introduces the **Flowxi backend platform** from a technical and architectural perspective.

Flowxi is a **private, internal backend** designed to power Flowxi products.
It exposes a set of controlled APIs used by frontend applications and internal systems.

This documentation focuses on **how the platform is structured**, not on marketing or sales.

---

## Scope of the platform

Flowxi is responsible for:

- User identity and access control
- Secure authentication and session management
- Wallet and balance infrastructure
- Financial operations and transfers
- Compliance and verification workflows
- Localization of all user-facing responses

Anything outside this scope is handled by external systems or frontend applications.

## Core design principles

Flowxi follows a small set of strict principles:

- **Security first**  
  Every action is authenticated, authorized, and audited.
- **API-first**  
  All features are exposed through versioned HTTP APIs.
- **State-driven logic**  
  Users, wallets, and compliance rely on explicit states.
- **Deterministic behavior**  
  Same input, same output. No hidden side effects.
- **Localization by default**  
  Errors and messages are returned in the user language  
  (FR by default, EN fallback).

## High-level architecture

At a high level, the platform is composed of the following layers:

1. **Authentication & access control**  
   Tokens, sessions, 2FA, rate limiting.
2. **User & identity management**  
   User lifecycle, roles, and statuses.
3. **Wallet & financial core**  
   Balances, transactions, and movements.
4. **Compliance layer**  
   KYC, document validation, regulatory states.
5. **Communication & localization**  
   Emails, notifications, and translated responses.

Each layer is documented in its own section.

## How to navigate this documentation

- Start with **Authentication & security** to understand access rules
- Use **API reference** for endpoint-level details
- Refer to **Errors & localization** to handle failures correctly

This documentation assumes familiarity with REST APIs and frontend-backend integration.
